  Hi, my name is Samuel Letellier-Duchesne and I am currently a researcher looking for an opportunity to make my mark
  in the industry. I have worked on urban building energy modeling both during my PHD and futher more as a Postdoc
  Fellow in the Sustainbale Design Lab at MIT. I have experience making software and web apps that enable various
  data-driven workflows in the field of Building Science.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>C#</mark> and more recently I have been developing
  <mark>REST APIs</mark> and web micro servives for this internet age.
  
  My topics of expertise are:
  - District Energy Modelling
  - Building Energy Modelling (<mark>EnergyPlus</mark> & <mark>TRNSYS</mark> have no secrets for me)
  - Geographic information system through <mark>QGIS</mark>, <mark>PostGIS</mark> databases and python scripting
  <mark>GeoPandas</mark>
  - Linear and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (Optimization).

          Democratization of urban building energy modeling.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project with Yu Qian Ang and Zach Berzolla to accelerate the creation of Urban Building
          Energy Models (UBEMs). This project tought me how to develop and maintain a microservice on <mark>AWS</mark>.
          
          The backbone of UBEM.io consists of 3 projects that I developed independently: [<mark>pyumi</mark>](#pyumi),
          [<mark>archetypal</mark>](#archetypal) and [<mark>umitemplatedb</mark>](#umitemplatedb).
  
          With UBEM.io, municipalities, consultants and researchers can upload a GIS footprint file with a *height*
          attribute, and download an UMI project file which can be opened in [UMI for Rhino](http://web.mit
          .edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/umi/index.html). After an energy simulation is run, the file can be
          uploaded to the [Urban Model Visualizer](http://www.ubem.io/Results) to display a rich energy performance
          summary.

          This project was an opportunity to learn about Rhino 3DM files and the structure of Rhino 3D models. Using the
          recently open-sourced [rhino3dm](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm) library, I was able to create UMI
          projects from scratch in a python environment without the use of the proprietary [RhinoCommon
          API](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/R_Project_RhinoCommon.htm).
          
          The package enables scripted workflows to open UMI projects and process the various module results (energy,
          mobility, district energy, etc.). It also enables the creation of new UMI projects from GIS files: import
          footprints, extrude geometries in 3D sapce and assign building template names based on a combination of
          feature attributes.
          
          pyumi enables the [Urban Model Generator](http://www.ubem.io/getstarted) as well as the [Urban Model
          Visualizer](http://www.ubem.io/Results).

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project around the begining of my PhD as a way of learning to code in Python, but also out
          of frustration with running Commercial Reference Building <mark>EnergyPlus</mark> models. Ep-Launch is
          clunky and it is a pain to upgrade old models to newer versions of EnergyPlus. Furthermore, I needed a way
          to efficiently read IDF models, run them and retreive their results all in a Jupyter Notebook, the crown
          jewel of reproducible data analysis workflows.
          
          I leveraged the excellent eppy package to do the heavy lifting of parsing IDF models, but I
          rewrote the whole logic to handle file upgrades and simulation results. From this robust IDF model scripting
          language, I developed the model complexity reduction algorithms to create simplified 2-zone UMI models out
          of complexe multi-zone IDF models. This in turn enabled the creation of building templates for the [umi
          template database](#umitemplatedb).

          The umitemplatedb project was created out of a necessity to store and retreive UMI <mark>Template Library
          Files</mark>. The project defines the building template format, the backbone of UMI projects and handles
          the conversion of UMI Template Library Files to <mark>MongoDB</mark> documents and vice-versa.

          As a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Sustainable Design Lab, I undertake reaserch at the intersection of urban building 
          energy modeling and district energy systems modeling to guide city planners, architects and engineers, 
          in designing and planning efficient buildings and urban systems.

          I delivered a feasibility study for the implementation of an urban energy sharing network for the site of the De la Commune Service Yard. 
          The study used an advanced topology optimization algorithm I developed during my PhD to explore various connectivity scenarios 
          with an adjacent district energy plant. Also in the report, I outlined economic, legal, and technical opportunites and barriers for the project.
          
          This report in addition to my help writing the "Energy Efficiency & Green Energy Production" chapter of the project's proposal document 
          helped our team secure the bid for the competition.
