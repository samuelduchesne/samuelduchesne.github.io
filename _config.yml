  Hi, my name is Samuel Letellier-Duchesne and I am currently a researcher looking for an opportunity to make my mark
  in the industry. I have worked on urban building energy modeling both during my PHD and futher more as a Postdoc
  Fellow in the Sustainbale Design Lab at MIT. I have experience making software and web apps that enable various
  data-driven workflows in the field of Building Science.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>C#</mark> and more recently I have been developing
  <mark>REST APIs</mark> and web micro servives for this internet age.
  
  My topics of expertise are:
  - District Energy Modelling
  - Building Energy Modelling (<mark>EnergyPlus</mark> & <mark>TRNSYS</mark> have no secrets for me)
  - Geographic information system through <mark>QGIS</mark>, <mark>PostGIS</mark> databases and python scripting
  <mark>GeoPandas</mark>
  - Linear and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (Optimization).

          I started this project with Yu Qian Ang and Zach Berzolla to accelerate the creation of UBEMs. This
          project tought me how to develop and maintain a microservice on <mark>AWS</mark>.
          
          The backbone of UBEM.io consists of 3 projects that I developed: [pyumi](#pyumi),
          <mark>archetypal</mark> and <mark>umitemplatedb</mark>.
  
          Upload a GIS footprint file with a *height* attribute, and get an UMI project file which can be opened in
          [UMI for Rhino](http://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/umi/index.html). After the energy
          simulation is run, upload your file to the [Urban Model Visualizer](http://www.ubem.io/Results) to display a
          rich energy performance summary.

          This project was an opportunity to learn about Rhino 3DM files and the structure of Rhino 3D models. Using the
          recently open-sourced [rhino3dm](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm) library, I was able to create UMI
          projects from scratch in a <mark>python</mark> environment without the use of the proprietary [RhinoCommon
          API](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/R_Project_RhinoCommon.htm).
          
          The package enables scripted workflows to open UMI projects and read the various module results. It also
          enables the creation of new UMI projects from GIS files: import footprints, extrude geometries in 3D sapce
          and assign building template names based on a combination of feature attributes.
          
          pyumi enables the [Urban Model Generator](http://www.ubem.io/getstarted) as well as the [Urban Model Visualizer]
          (http://www.ubem.io/Results).

          I started this project around the begining of my PhD as a way of learning to code in Python, but also out
          of frustration with running Commercial Reference Building <mark>EnergyPlus</mark> models. Ep-Launch is
          clunky and it is a pain to upgrade old models to newer versions of EnergyPlus. Furthermore, I needed a way
          to efficiently read IDF models, run them and retreive their results all in a Jupyter Notebook, the crown
          jewel of reproducible data analysis workflows.
          
          I leveraged the excellent <mark>eppy</mark> package to do the heavy lifting of parsing IDF models, but I
          rewrote the whole logic to handle file upgrades and simulation results. From this robust IDF model scriptng
          language, I developed the reduction algorithms to created simplified 2-zone UMI models out of complexe
          multi-zone IDF models.

          The umitemplatedb project was created out of a necessity to store and retreive UMI <mark>Template Library
          Files</mark>. The project defines the building template format, the backbone of UMI projects.

          Pursuing a PhD in mecahnical engineering derives from my interest in the built environement and how design
          decisions can early on impact the sustainability of a project.

          During my time at Polytechnique Montréal, I
  
          I learned most of my key skills that have I have taken through my
          career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
  
          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
